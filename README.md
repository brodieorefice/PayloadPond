# PayloadPond

Welcome to **PayloadPond**, a repository dedicated to storing and sharing payloads for the USB Rubber Ducky. The USB Rubber Ducky is a powerful penetration testing tool disguised as a USB drive, capable of injecting keystroke payloads into target systems at lightning speed.

This repository serves as a collection of useful, creative, and effective payloads for ethical hacking, penetration testing, and automation purposes.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories based on the purpose of each payload. Here‚Äôs how it‚Äôs structured:

- **`/payloads/`**  
  Contains categorized payloads for different use cases.
  - **`/exfiltration/`** - Scripts for extracting sensitive data.
  - **`/pranks/`** - Fun and harmless pranks.
  - **`/automation/`** - Scripts to automate repetitive tasks.
  - **`/recon/`** - Payloads for network and system reconnaissance.
  - **`/exploitation/`** - Scripts for privilege escalation or exploiting known vulnerabilities.

- **`/scripts/`**  
  Utility scripts for encoding payloads, testing, or customizing the Rubber Ducky firmware.
