# Note: 

Windows scripts are currently in development along with other OS's. Personally I write ones for Mac first as that's the os i'm on, and then translate them to a Linux verson if required. Only after that I will write a Windows equivalent because of the vast differences. 



# PayloadPond

Welcome to **PayloadPond**, a repository dedicated to storing and sharing payloads for the USB Rubber Ducky. The USB Rubber Ducky is a powerful penetration testing tool disguised as a USB drive, capable of injecting keystroke payloads into target systems at lightning speed.

This repository serves as a collection of useful, creative, and effective payloads for ethical hacking, penetration testing, and automation purposes.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories based on the purpose of each payload. Here‚Äôs how it‚Äôs structured:

- **`/macos/linux or windows /`**  
  Contains categorized payloads for different use cases.
  - **`/exfiltration/`** - Scripts for extracting sensitive data.
  - **`/pranks/`** - Fun and harmless pranks.
  - **`/automation/`** - Scripts to automate repetitive tasks.
  - **`/recon/`** - Payloads for network and system reconnaissance.
  - **`/exploitation/`** - Scripts for privilege escalation or exploiting known vulnerabilities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

To use these payloads, you‚Äôll need:
1. A USB Rubber Ducky device.
2. The DuckEncoder tool to compile `.txt` payloads into `.bin` files.
3. A target system for testing.
